  abstract = {Temporal changes to the concentration of molecular species such as mRNA, which take place in response to various environmental cues, can often be modeled as simple continuous functions such as a single pulse (impulse) model. The simplicity of such functional representations can provide an improved performance on fundamental tasks such as noise reduction, imputation and differential expression analysis. However, temporal gene expression profiles are often studied with models that treat time as a categorical variable, neglecting the dependence between time points. Here, we present ImpulseDE2, a framework for differential expression analysis that combines the power of the impulse model as a continuous representation of temporal responses along with a noise model tailored specifically to sequencing data. We compare the simple categorical models to ImpulseDE2 and to other continuous models based on natural cubic splines and demonstrate the utility of the continuous approach for studying differential expression in time course sequencing experiments. A unique feature of ImpulseDE2 is the ability to distinguish permanently from transiently up- or down-regulated genes. Using an in vitro differentiation dataset, we demonstrate that this gene classification scheme can be used to highlight distinct transcriptional programs that are associated with different phases of the differentiation process.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: Large-scale transcriptome studies with multiple samples per individual are widely used to study disease biology. Yet, current methods for differential expression are inadequate for cross-individual testing for these repeated measures designs. Most problematic, we observe across multiple datasets that current methods can give reproducible false-positive findings that are driven by genetic regulation of gene expression, yet are unrelated to the trait of interest. Here, we introduce a statistical software package, dream, that increases power, controls the false positive rate, enables multiple types of hypothesis tests, and integrates with standard workflows. In 12 analyses in 6 independent datasets, dream yields biological insight not found with existing software while addressing the issue of reproducible false-positive findings. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Dream is available within the variancePartition Bioconductor package at http://bioconductor.org/packages/variancePartition. CONTACT: gabriel.hoffman@mssm.edu. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We develop TimeMeter, a statistical method and tool to assess temporal gene expression similarity, and identify differentially progressing genes where one pattern is more temporally advanced than the other. We apply TimeMeter to several datasets, and show that TimeMeter is capable of characterizing complicated temporal gene expression associations. Interestingly, we find: (i) the measurement of differential progression provides a novel feature in addition to pattern similarity that can characterize early developmental divergence between two species; (ii) genes exhibiting similar temporal patterns between human and mouse during neural differentiation are under strong negative (purifying) selection during evolution; (iii) analysis of genes with similar temporal patterns in mouse digit regeneration and axolotl blastema differentiation reveals common gene groups for appendage regeneration with potential implications in regenerative medicine.},

  abstract = {Transcriptome-wide time series expression profiling is used to characterize the cellular response to environmental perturbations. The first step to analyzing transcriptional response data is often to cluster genes with similar responses. Here, we present a nonparametric model-based method, Dirichlet process Gaussian process mixture model (DPGP), which jointly models data clusters with a Dirichlet process and temporal dependencies with Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the accuracy of DPGP in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches using hundreds of simulated data sets. To further test our method, we apply DPGP to published microarray data from a microbial model organism exposed to stress and to novel RNA-seq data from a human cell line exposed to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We validate our clusters by examining local transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Our results demonstrate that jointly modeling cluster number and temporal dependencies can reveal shared regulatory mechanisms.

RESULTS: We have updated maSigPro to support RNA-seq time series analysis by introducing generalized linear models in the algorithm to support the modeling of count data while maintaining the traditional functionalities of the package. We show a good performance of the maSigPro-GLM method in several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset.

These applications are particularly relevant in stimuli-response models under environmental conditions, characterization of gradient biological processes in developmental biology, identification of therapeutic effects in clinical trials, disease progressive models, cell-cycle, and circadian periodicity. Despite their feasibility and popularity, sophisticated dynamic methods that are well validated in large-scale comparative studies, in terms of statistical and computational rigor, are less benchmarked, comparing to their static counterparts. To date, a number of novel methods in bulk RNA-Seq data have been developed for the various time-dependent stimuli, circadian rhythms, cell-lineage in differentiation, and disease progression. Here, we comprehensively review a key set of representative dynamic strategies and discuss current issues associated with the detection of dynamically changing genes. We also provide recommendations for future directions for studying non-periodical, periodical time course data, and meta-dynamic datasets.},

While standard differential expression (DE) analysis between two conditions has been extensively studied, and improved over the past decades, RNA-seq time course (TC) DE analysis algorithms are still in their early stages. In this study, we compare, for the first time, existing TC RNA-seq tools on an extensive simulation data set and validated the best performing tools on published data. Surprisingly, TC tools were outperformed by the classical pairwise comparison approach on short time series ({$<$}8 time points) in terms of overall performance and robustness to noise, mostly because of high number of false positives, with the exception of ImpulseDE2. Overlapping of candidate lists between tools improved this shortcoming, as the majority of false-positive, but not true-positive, candidates were unique for each method. On longer time series, pairwise approach was less efficient on the overall performance compared with splineTC and maSigPro, which did not identify any false-positive candidate.},

  abstract = {High-throughput technologies produce gene expression time-series data that need fast and specialized algorithms to be processed. While current methods already deal with different aspects, such as the non-stationarity of the process and the temporal correlation, they often fail to take into account the pairing among replicates. We propose PairGP, a non-stationary Gaussian process method to compare gene expression time-series across several conditions that can account for paired longitudinal study designs and can identify groups of conditions that have different gene expression dynamics. We demonstrate the method on both simulated data and previously unpublished RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) time-series with five conditions. The results show the advantage of modeling the pairing effect to better identify groups of conditions with different dynamics. The pairing effect model displays good capabilities of selecting the most probable grouping of conditions even in the presence of a high number of conditions. The developed method is of general application and can be applied to any gene expression time series dataset. The model can identify common replicate effects among the samples coming from the same biological replicates and model those as separate components. Learning the pairing effect as a separate component, not only allows us to exclude it from the model to get better estimates of the condition effects, but also to improve the precision of the model selection process. The pairing effect that was accounted before as noise, is now identified as a separate component, resulting in more accurate and explanatory models of the data.},
