  abstract = {Temporal changes to the concentration of molecular species such as mRNA, which take place in response to various environmental cues, can often be modeled as simple continuous functions such as a single pulse (impulse) model. The simplicity of such functional representations can provide an improved performance on fundamental tasks such as noise reduction, imputation and differential expression analysis. However, temporal gene expression profiles are often studied with models that treat time as a categorical variable, neglecting the dependence between time points. Here, we present ImpulseDE2, a framework for differential expression analysis that combines the power of the impulse model as a continuous representation of temporal responses along with a noise model tailored specifically to sequencing data. We compare the simple categorical models to ImpulseDE2 and to other continuous models based on natural cubic splines and demonstrate the utility of the continuous approach for studying differential expression in time course sequencing experiments. A unique feature of ImpulseDE2 is the ability to distinguish permanently from transiently up- or down-regulated genes. Using an in vitro differentiation dataset, we demonstrate that this gene classification scheme can be used to highlight distinct transcriptional programs that are associated with different phases of the differentiation process.},

  abstract = {RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is a flexible technology for measuring genome-wide expression that is rapidly replacing microarrays as costs become comparable. Current differential expression analysis methods for RNA-seq data fall into two broad classes: (1) methods that quantify expression within the boundaries of genes previously published in databases and (2) methods that attempt to reconstruct full length RNA transcripts. The first class cannot discover differential expression outside of previously known genes. While the second approach does possess discovery capabilities, statistical analysis of differential expression is complicated by the ambiguity and variability incurred while assembling transcripts and estimating their abundances. Here, we propose a novel method that first identifies differentially expressed regions (DERs) of interest by assessing differential expression at each base of the genome. The method then segments the genome into regions comprised of bases showing similar differential expression signal, and then assigns a measure of statistical significance to each region. Optionally, DERs can be annotated using a reference database of genomic features. We compare our approach with leading competitors from both current classes of differential expression methods and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each. A software implementation of our method is available on github (https://github.com/alyssafrazee/derfinder).},

Most clinical studies showed improved bronchodilatation, but limited benefits from using levalbuterol.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cyclo-oxygenase 2 inhibitor rofecoxib was recently withdrawn because of cardiovascular adverse effects. An increased risk of myocardial infarction had been observed in 2000 in the Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcomes Research study (VIGOR), but was attributed to cardioprotection of naproxen rather than a cardiotoxic effect of rofecoxib. We used standard and cumulative random-effects meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials and observational studies to establish whether robust evidence on the adverse effects of rofecoxib was available before September, 2004. METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases and relevant files of the US Food and Drug Administration. We included all randomised controlled trials in patients with chronic musculoskeletal disorders that compared rofecoxib with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or placebo, and cohort and case-control studies of cardiovascular risk and naproxen. Myocardial infarction was the primary endpoint. FINDINGS: We identified 18 randomised controlled trials and 11 observational studies. By the end of 2000 (52 myocardial infarctions, 20742 patients) the relative risk from randomised controlled trials was 2.30 (95\% CI 1.22-4.33, p=0.010), and 1 year later (64 events, 21432 patients) it was 2.24 (1.24-4.02, p=0.007). There was little evidence that the relative risk differed depending on the control group (placebo, non-naproxen NSAID, or naproxen; p=0.41) or trial duration (p=0.82). In observational studies, the cardioprotective effect of naproxen was small (combined estimate 0.86 [95\% CI 0.75-0.99]) and could not have explained the findings of the VIGOR trial. INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that rofecoxib should have been withdrawn several years earlier. The reasons why manufacturer and drug licensing authorities did not continuously monitor and summarise the accumulating evidence need to be clarified.},

Due to the increasing number of chemicals in use and the high rate of drug candidate failure due to toxicity, it is imperative to develop in vitro, high-throughput screening methods to determine toxicity. The Tox21 program, a unique research consortium of federal public health agencies, was established to address and identify toxicity concerns in a high-throughput, concentration-responsive manner using a battery of in vitro assays. In this article, we review the advancements in high-throughput robotic screening methodology and informatics processes to enable the generation of toxicological data, and their impact on the field; further, we discuss the future of assessing environmental toxicity utilizing efficient and scalable methods that better represent the corresponding biological and toxicodynamic processes in humans.

All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systems biologists work with many kinds of data, from many different sources, using a variety of software tools. Each of these tools typically excels at one type of analysis, such as of microarrays, of metabolic networks and of predicted protein structure. A crucial challenge is to combine the capabilities of these (and other forthcoming) data resources and tools to create a data exploration and analysis environment that does justice to the variety and complexity of systems biology data sets. A solution to this problem should recognize that data types, formats and software in this high throughput age of biology are constantly changing. RESULTS: In this paper we describe the Gaggle -a simple, open-source Java software environment that helps to solve the problem of software and database integration. Guided by the classic software engineering strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it integrates existing popular programs and web resources into a user-friendly, easily-extended environment. We demonstrate that four simple data types (names, matrices, networks, and associative arrays) are sufficient to bring together diverse databases and software. We highlight some capabilities of the Gaggle with an exploration of Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis genes, in which we identify a putative ricin-like protein -a discovery made possible by simultaneous data exploration using a wide range of publicly available data and a variety of popular bioinformatics software tools. CONCLUSION: We have integrated diverse databases (for example, KEGG, BioCyc, String) and software (Cytoscape, DataMatrixViewer, R statistical environment, and TIGR Microarray Expression Viewer). Through this loose coupling of diverse software and databases the Gaggle enables simultaneous exploration of experimental data (mRNA and protein abundance, protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions), functional associations (operon, chromosomal proximity, phylogenetic pattern), metabolic pathways (KEGG) and Pubmed abstracts (STRING web resource), creating an exploratory environment useful to 'web browser and spreadsheet biologists', to statistically savvy computational biologists, and those in between. The Gaggle uses Java RMI and Java Web Start technologies and can be found at http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous work has shown that the hypersaline-adapted archaeon, Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1, is highly resistant to oxidative stress caused by exposure to hydrogen peroxide, UV, and gamma radiation. Dynamic alteration of the gene regulatory network (GRN) has been implicated in such resistance. However, the molecular functions of transcription regulatory proteins involved in this response remain unknown. RESULTS: Here we have reanalyzed several existing GRN and systems biology datasets for H. salinarum to identify and characterize a novel winged helix-turn-helix transcription factor, VNG0258H, as a regulator required for reactive oxygen species resistance in this organism. This protein appears to be unique to the haloarchaea at the primary sequence level. High throughput quantitative growth assays in a deletion mutant strain implicate VNG0258H in extreme oxidative stress resistance. According to time course gene expression analyses, this transcription factor is required for the appropriate dynamic response of nearly 300 genes to reactive oxygen species damage from paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. These genes are predicted to function in repair of oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. In vivo DNA binding assays demonstrate that VNG0258H binds DNA to mediate gene regulation. CONCLUSIONS: Together these results suggest that VNG0258H is a novel archaeal transcription factor that regulates gene expression to enable adaptation to the extremely oxidative, hypersaline niche of H. salinarum. We have therefore renamed VNG0258H as RosR, for reactive oxygen species regulator.},

While standard differential expression (DE) analysis between two conditions has been extensively studied, and improved over the past decades, RNA-seq time course (TC) DE analysis algorithms are still in their early stages. In this study, we compare, for the first time, existing TC RNA-seq tools on an extensive simulation data set and validated the best performing tools on published data. Surprisingly, TC tools were outperformed by the classical pairwise comparison approach on short time series ({$<$}8 time points) in terms of overall performance and robustness to noise, mostly because of high number of false positives, with the exception of ImpulseDE2. Overlapping of candidate lists between tools improved this shortcoming, as the majority of false-positive, but not true-positive, candidates were unique for each method. On longer time series, pairwise approach was less efficient on the overall performance compared with splineTC and maSigPro, which did not identify any false-positive candidate.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide high-throughput sequencing (HTS) time series experiments are a powerful tool for monitoring various genomic elements over time. They can be used to monitor, for example, gene or transcript expression with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), DNA methylation levels with bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq), or abundances of genetic variants in populations with pooled sequencing (Pool-seq). However, because of high experimental costs, the time series data sets often consist of a very limited number of time points with very few or no biological replicates, posing challenges in the data analysis. RESULTS: Here we present the GPrank R package for modelling genome-wide time series by incorporating variance information obtained during pre-processing of the HTS data using probabilistic quantification methods or from a beta-binomial model using sequencing depth. GPrank is well-suited for analysing both short and irregularly sampled time series. It is based on modelling each time series by two Gaussian process (GP) models, namely, time-dependent and time-independent GP models, and comparing the evidence provided by data under two models by computing their Bayes factor (BF). Genomic elements are then ranked by their BFs, and temporally most dynamic elements can be identified. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating the variance information helps GPrank avoid false positives without compromising computational efficiency. Fitted models can be easily further explored in a browser. Detection and visualisation of temporally most active dynamic elements in the genome can provide a good starting point for further downstream analyses for increasing our understanding of the studied processes.},

While current methods already deal with different aspects, such as the non-stationarity of the process and the temporal correlation, they often fail to take into account the pairing among replicates. We propose PairGP, a non-stationary Gaussian process method to compare gene expression time-series across several conditions that can account for paired longitudinal study designs and can identify groups of conditions that have different gene expression dynamics. We demonstrate the method on both simulated data and previously unpublished RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) time-series with five conditions. The results show the advantage of modeling the pairing effect to better identify groups of conditions with different dynamics. The pairing effect model displays good capabilities of selecting the most probable grouping of conditions even in the presence of a high number of conditions. The developed method is of general application and can be applied to any gene expression time series dataset. The model can identify common replicate effects among the samples coming from the same biological replicates and model those as separate components. Learning the pairing effect as a separate component, not only allows us to exclude it from the model to get better estimates of the condition effects, but also to improve the precision of the model selection process. The pairing effect that was accounted before as noise, is now identified as a separate component, resulting in more accurate and explanatory models of the data.},

Whereas in acute exposure, where the clinical course of an overdose to all 3 drugs is predictable in relation to the amount ingested, in chronic exposure to therapeutic doses of aspirin and ibuprofen, the development of gastric ulcers and analgesic nephropathy is unpredictable. Ibuprofen is not recommended for prolonged treatment in dogs and cats due to the likelihood of ulcer formation. Although gastric mucosal adaptation usually occurs with repeated therapeutic doses of aspirin, some individuals nevertheless develop gastric ulcers; simultaneous administration of the prostaglandin analogue misoprostol can reduce the risk. Following acute ingestion of aspirin or ibuprofen, treatment is essentially symptomatic and supportive following early decontamination procedures. Gastrointestinal protectants and i.v. fluids with sodium bicarbonate are generally recommended. Acetaminophen toxicosis is usually associated with single acute ingestion, and the primary target organs affected are the liver and the red blood cells in dogs and cats respectively. Because signs can progress rapidly with acute acetaminophen overdose, administration of N-acetylcysteine is always recommended, even when the history is unclear. This report summarizes the common clinical presentations of dogs and cats exposed to therapeutic or excessive doses of ibuprofen, aspirin or acetaminophen, and describes the treatment procedures advised by the ASPCA-National Animal Poison Control Center.},
