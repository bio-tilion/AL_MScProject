% regulatory certainty, standard
% NANs too simplistic

% looking at molecular level changes

% gaussian and models only needed in time course
% linear model is not linear regression

% simple linear model is a simple linear regression

% linear regression: linear combination of coefficients
% decompose into linear pieces
% apply least square algorythm the output vector is the expectation of joint dist (aka gaussian)

% linear model cannot understand duration (time points are independent)
% where gaussian process comes in

% gaussian process do not specify a model function. it finds most probable function that fits the data
% bayesian fits into everything: put a prior on every parameter (non-parametric approach)

% DESeq2 : categorical time
% ImpulseDE2 : functional time
% PairGP + DPGP : non-parametric time

% gaussian process
% prob. dist. of trajectory of the fit
% 
%  stochasticity of output if you don't set seed

% gaussian is non-parametric; what is parametric approach?
% DESeq2 has spline interpolation (treats time as continuos var)
%  spline=non linear fitting method
% time is important when time points are not independent

% why space and time cannot be swapt
% auto-regressive processes answer that problem\usepackage{rotating}

% I think this "negative" result is important. It shows that one simulated with certain simulation assumptions, it can be difficult to make conclusive interpretations
